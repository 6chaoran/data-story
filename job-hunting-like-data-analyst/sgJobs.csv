To help us appeal to a larger audience, be mindful that many phrases, concepts and ideas may be new to some readers. Find a balance that satisfies experienced industry players and new readers, never leave any reader in the dark. Jargon and acronym-only references should, in general, be avoided. For example, we can assume our audience should know what the IMO is but we should not expect them all to know what AMSA is, so write Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) in a first reference and AMSA thereafter.
