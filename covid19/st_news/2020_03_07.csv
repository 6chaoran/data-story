An increasing number of people were asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and sports and music events were cancelled, stores were cleared of staples like toiletries and water, and face masks became a common sight.
The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with six countries reporting their first cases on Friday.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said every country should make containing the epidemic its top priority, pointing to Iran’s national action plan to combat one of the worst outbreaks after a slow start.
Iran’s death toll from the virus jumped to 124, as more than 1,000 new cases were diagnosed over 24 hours.
In the United States, the world’s economic powerhouse, at least 57 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed as the virus struck for the first time in Colorado, Maryland, Tennessee and Texas, as well as San Francisco in California. Some 230 people have been infected in total and 12 have died.
More than 2,000 people were stranded on the Grand Princess cruise ship after it was barred from returning to port in San Francisco because at least 35 people aboard developed flu-like symptoms. Test kits were delivered at sea.
US President Donald Trump signed a bill allocating US$8.3 billion (S$11 billion) to bolster testing for the virus and other action.
Moves by some major economies including the United States to cut interest rates and pledge billions of dollars to fight the epidemic have done little to allay fears about the spread of the disease and the economic fallout. Supply chains are crippled around the world, especially in China, where the outbreak began.
“There’s concern that while there has been a response from the Fed, given the nature of the problem, is this something the central bank can really help with?” said John Davies, G10 rates strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in London.
In New York, JPMorgan divided its team between central locations and a secondary site in New Jersey while Goldman Sachs sent some traders to nearby secondary offices in Greenwich, Connecticut and Jersey City.
In London, Europe’s financial capital, the Canary Wharf district was unusually quiet. S&P Global’s large office stood empty after the company sent its 1,200 staff home, while HSBC asked around 100 people to work from home after a worker tested positive for the illness.
Facebook said it was closing its London offices until Monday after a visiting employee from Singapore was diagnosed with the virus.
European stocks continued their slide after the Japanese market dropped to a six-month low, with 97 per cent of shares on the Tokyo exchange’s main board in the red.
Airline and travel stocks have been among the worst affected as people cancelled non-essential travel. Norwegian Air Shuttle , the hardest-hit stock among European carriers, lost more than quarter of its market value on Friday and has fallen almost 70 per cent since the start of February.
“If this really ramps up, we could see a lot more kitchen-sinking updates from the travel industry and airlines,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
Yields on US Treasuries plunged to historic lows on Friday as fears the outbreak will slam the global economy drove investors to snap up risk-adverse assets and dump equities, overshadowing data highlighting a strong US labour market.
MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.87 per cent and emerging market stocks lost 2.43 per cent.
In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index fell 3.35 per cent. The travel and leisure sub-index slid 3.9 per cent.
New York’s Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5 per cent.
More than 100,300 people have been infected globally, according to a Reuters tally based on statements from health ministries and government officials.
Mainland China has seen more than 3,000 deaths, but the epidemic is now spreading faster elsewhere. The death toll in Italy, which has suffered Europe’s worst outbreak, rose to 197.
About 3.4 per cent of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus – known as Covid-19 – have died, far above seasonal flu’s fatality rate of under 1 per cent, the WHO said this week.
Singapore reported 13 new infections on Friday, its biggest daily jump, including a Singapore Airlines cabin crew member.
Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft advised employees in the Seattle area to work from home, after some caught the virus. The companies’ work-from-home recommendation will affect more than 100,000 people in the area.
Starbucks said it had stopped accepting reusable cups and thermos flasks from customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, though it will still honour the promised discount for anyone carrying one."
1,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/how-lethal-is-the-coronavirus-experts-differ-over-diseases-death-rate,How lethal is the coronavirus? Experts differ over disease's death rate,"SINGAPORE - As the world enters its third month of grappling with the fast-spreading coronavirus, one question that has dogged governments and medical practitioners is exactly how dangerous the new disease is.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) this week put the Covid-19 global death rate at about 3.4 per cent - far higher than the seasonal flu's 0.1 per cent - but US President Donald Trump has cast doubt on its accuracy.
""Well, I think the 3.4 per cent is really a false number,"" Mr Trump was quoted by The New York Times as saying on Wednesday (March 4).
""Now, this is just my hunch, and - but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this ... it's very mild,"" he said ""So, if we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work - some of them go to work, but they get better.""
There may be merit to Mr Trump's comments.
The WHO's ballpark figure reflects a simple calculation based on the number of deaths and confirmed cases. It does not account for mild, undetected cases. It is also mostly derived from the experience in China's Wuhan, the first epicentre of the outbreak, where infections soared before doctors managed to gather the knowledge and resources to battle it.
“Within the rest of China, the mortality rate is in fact much lower,” Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at Singapore’s Ministry of Health, told reporters at a press conference on Friday (March 6). “And perhaps that is a more accurate figure.” 
WHO has since clarified that the figure is a broad ""snapshot"" that will change as the outbreak evolves.
Experts expect the death rate to drop considerably when more information is made known about the illness.
The 3.4 per cent mortality figure ""is certainly an overestimate"", according to Mr Tom Frieden, a former director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and New York City health commissioner. The actual rate will probably be below 1 per cent, Mr Frieden told Bloomberg in an e-mail.
An editorial published in The New England Journal Of Medicine (NEJM) by Dr Anthony S. Fauci and Dr H. Clifford Lane, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr Robert R. Redfield, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, arrived at the same conclusion.
""If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1 per cent,"" the doctors wrote.
""This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1 per cent)… rather than a disease similar to Sars or Mers, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10 per cent and 36 per cent, respectively.""
Dr Bruce Aylward, who leads the WHO's coronavirus efforts, expects the fatality rate to turn out between 1 and 2 per cent, The New York Times reported.
Early estimates of the coronavirus death rate in China were about 2 per cent. A more updated report in NEJM based on over 1,000 patients across the country found it to be lower, at 1.4 per cent.
“At this point of time, there is nothing to suggest that the virus has changed in its virility,” Singapore’s Associate Professor Mak said. “But what has happened is that those figures have continued to change as more information becomes available.” 
In South Korea - the worst-hit country outside of China and where residents are being checked aggressively for the virus - the fatality rate comes in under 1 per cent. More than 6,000 infections have been detected in the country, and at least 40 people have died from it.
Calculations based only on total current cases and deaths are flawed, The New York Times reported Mr Adam Kucharski, a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, as saying. He described it as a ""statistical illusion"".
""(Based) on best available data, when we adjust for unreported cases and the various delays involved, we're probably looking at a fatality risk of probably between maybe 0.5 and 2 per cent for people with symptoms,"" said Mr Kucharski, who studies how diseases spread.
About 80 per cent of people infected with the coronavirus exhibit only mild symptoms while some experience none at all, the WHO has previously said. If many cases go undetected as a result, the virus is able to stealthily spread across communities while evading the WHO's tally, which experts use for analysis.
""A lot of people are asymptomatic,"" Professor Rosanna Peeling, director of the International Diagnostics Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Bloomberg. ""We're only seeing the cases that are confirmed and the cases of people presenting to the hospital because they can't breathe.""


As some infected individuals also take more time to present symptoms, hospitals around the world may not have been adequately equipped to detect and treat these patients, according to Prof Mak. 
Essentially, it is tough to pinpoint the true extent of the coronavirus’ lethality until governments get a better grasp of the situation in their countries and share the information transparently. 
“We’re not too fussed about whether or not (the death rate) changes over time, because we understand that this is in part driven by the statistics that are available,” Prof Mak said. 
“What’s important is to focus on our own local efforts to make sure that we detect as early as possible every case that comes on, and that we are able to treat them.” 
The epidemic has infected more than 98,000 people worldwide and killed over 3,300 as of Friday afternoon (March 6)."

Previously, this only applied to inbound flights from mainland China.
According to local broadcaster RTHK, the Health Department said travellers from the mainland can fill in the declaration on their mobile device, and this will be extended to all incoming travellers from 0000 hours on Sunday.
The department is also advising members of the public to delay all non-essential travel outside Hong Kong because of the spread of the coronavirus around the world.
It also said that the Centre for Health Protection has written to doctors and private hospitals to inform them that the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing on Covid-19 for samples submitted by private doctors. The move is intended to identify coronavirus cases early and minimise the spread of the disease."

4,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/mainland-china-reports-99-new-confirmed-cases-of-coronavirus-on-march-6,China reports almost all new infections outside Wuhan originated abroad,"BEIJING (REUTERS) - About a quarter of China’s new confirmed cases and almost all of those outside the epidemic’s epicentre in Wuhan originated outside the country on Friday (March 6), according to official data. 
Mainland China had 99 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday, down from 143 cases a day earlier and marking the lowest number since Jan 20, when the NHC started to publish nationwide figures. 
Outside of central China’s Hubei province, there were 25 new confirmed cases reported on March 6, of which 24 came from outside 
China. 
Most of these were in China’s northwestern Gansu province, from quarantined passengers who entered the provincial capital of Lanzhou on commercial flights from Iran between March 2 and March 5. 
The capital Beijing reported four new cases on Friday, of which three came from Italy, according to a notice from the Beijing health commission posted on its official Weibo account on Saturday.  There were also three cases in Shanghai that originated abroad, and one in Guangdong province on Friday, according to the National Health Commission. 
The total nationwide number of cases that originated outside China reached 60 as of the end of Friday. 
For the second day in a row, there were no new infections in Hubei outside of the provincial capital of Wuhan.  That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,651. 
The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China was 3,070 as of the end of Friday, up by 28 from the previous day.  The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 28 new deaths. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 21 people died."

Two others are believed to be imported cases, one linked to a previous case, and the last with no known links yet.
The private dinner function at Joy Garden restaurant is now linked to 17 cases in total. The nine new cases are Singaporeans between the ages of 33 and 70.
Not all were at the dinner.
Of the other confirmed cases, one is a 55-year-old Singtel staff.
Another is a 47-year-old Singaporean, a Singapore Airlines (SIA) steward who had been in South Africa from Feb 14 to 17 and France from Feb 22 to 24.
He is believed to be an imported case, that is, he got the virus outside Singapore. He tested positive for Covid-19 on March 5.
The other likely imported case is a 37-year-old Singapore permanent resident who was in Germany from Feb 27 to March 5. She was confirmed of having the infection on March 6.
The last case confirmed is a 77-year-old man with no recent travel history to affected regions. He had been in the same ward as Case 109 at Singapore General Hospital from Feb 29 to March 1.
Case 109 is a 70-year-old man who works at Fishmart Sakuraya in West Coast Road.
MOH said that ""as part of enhanced precautions, patients who have acute respiratory infections will be placed in wards with greater separation between patients to minimise the risk of infection"".
The 13 new cases confirmed is the biggest jump in a day.
To date, there are 130 confirmed cases. A total of 82 patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital.
Of the 48 still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Nine are in critical care in the intensive care unit.
In a statement on Friday afternoon, Singtel said: ""We regret to inform that one of our colleagues was diagnosed with Covid-19 last night. He is currently in hospital receiving treatment and we are supporting him and his family in every way we can.""
The immediate priority has been to manage and minimise the risk of infection at Singtel Comcentre 1, where the employee works on Level 20.
He was last in office on Feb 26 before going on medical leave. ""We have closed off Level 20 and an MOH-approved cleaning crew was brought in overnight to conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the entire floor"", the statement added.
There are currently six clusters of infection here in Singapore. The dinner function at Joy Garden Restaurant in Safra Jurong cluster is now the second largest. The five others are: the Wizlearn Technologies cluster, the Yong Thai Hang health products shop, the Grand Hyatt Singapore, a Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site and the former clusters at Grace Assembly of God and the Life Church and Missions Singapore that are now considered one cluster, as a result of the earlier discovery of a missing link between the two."
6,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/coronavirus-how-to-quarantine-yourself,Coronavirus: How to quarantine yourself,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - Stay home unless you must see a doctor. No work, school or shopping. If you must come out of your room, wear a mask. And don't share towels.
If you are among the thousands now self-quarantined because of possible infection with the coronavirus, these are a few of the new house rules, courtesy of your local health officials and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
Among people told to self-quarantine, isolate themselves or stay home are people returning from parts of China and Iran, those who developed symptoms after spending time in other countries with sustained community transmission, and those with no known exposure who are sick.
But many individuals who don't fit neatly into any of these categories and weren't asked to stay home are choosing to seclude themselves anyway because they don't want to put others at risk. California has more than 5,500 people in self-quarantine. More than 2,700 are in seclusion in New York City alone.
It may sound like a vacation from reality, an ideal time to binge on Netflix and catch up on sleep. In fact, it's not easy to lock yourself away from family and friends. There are practical and logistical challenges and yawning gaps in the official advice that make it even harder.
The terms of home isolation can be onerous and may last for two weeks, which is the presumed incubation period for the virus. It is especially challenging if you have young children or elderly relatives to care for, or live in cramped quarters with a lot of roommates.
If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your elderly aunt. You shouldn't even pet your dog. And definitely no snuggling with your pet (no licking).
If you don't have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. You should use a separate bathroom, if you have one.
No visitors and no staff, unless it's absolutely essential. Don't take the bus or subway, not even a taxi.
If you must be around other people - in your home, or in a car because you're on your way to see a doctor, and only after you called first - you should wear a mask, and everyone else should, too.
But first, you or one of your friends or family members have to find masks, which are sold out almost everywhere.
If you cough or sneeze, you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue and discard the used tissue in a lined trash can. Then you must immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
You can use sanitizer, if you can find it, but soap and water are preferred.
Even if you haven't coughed or sneezed, you should wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth if you haven't just washed them.
Don't share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels or bedding with anyone (including your pets). Wash these items after you use them.
Countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables are considered ""high-touch surfaces""; wipe them often with a household cleanser.
Frequently wipe down surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids, including blood and stool.
Keep an eye on your health and call a doctor if your symptoms are getting worse. Make sure to tell the medical staff you are being monitored for the coronavirus.
Family members and other occupants should monitor the patient's symptoms and call a health provider if they see a turn for the worse.
Housemates can go to work or school, but it's going to be their job to stock up on groceries, pick up prescriptions, take care of the quarantined and keep the place clean. They'll be wiping down doorknobs and countertops, doing loads of laundry and washing their hands - a lot.
When around the patient, household members must wear a face mask, and both mask and gloves if they have contact with the patient's bodily fluids. These should be thrown away immediately, never reused.
Elderly members of the household and those with chronic medical conditions are at particular risk if they are infected. Contact with the secluded individual should be minimised.
Other occupants of the home should wash their hands frequently and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. They should stay in a room separate from that of the exposed or sick individual. If feasible, other members of the household should not share a bathroom with the secluded person.
They should monitor their own health, too, and call a doctor if they develop a cough, fever or shortness of breath.
No one pays you for self-quarantine. There is no reimbursement for products you may need, no government-paid nurse to stop by the home and help out. Self-quarantine is a hardship for both those who have families and those who live alone.
Not everyone can work remotely. A two-week absence from work can take an enormous financial toll on hourly wage workers who have to clock in and show up to get paid or who are part of the gig economy with no single employer.
Many Americans, maybe most, live paycheck to paycheck.
""We have to have social interventions to incentivise and support isolation, or we are doomed,"" said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at the New York University Langone Medical Centre.
People with no health insurance, inadequate insurance or no regular doctor will be reluctant to seek care if they have symptoms, fearing steep medical bills, he noted. Individuals living in the country illegally, fearful of being discovered and deported, may avoid diagnosis and care.
""I don't see the state or federal government preparing for this in any way,"" Caplan added.
Senator Patty Murray, and Representative Rosa DeLauro, have introduced legislation that would require all employers to let workers accrue seven days of sick leave, while providing another 14 days for immediate use during a public health emergency.
Washington state's website says the health department can help with groceries for those unable to leave their homes and even intervene with employers on their behalf if necessary.
Providing for people who make sacrifices for the greater good is crucial, said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre on National and Global Health Law.
""We ought to have a social compact: If you're sick, whether you've got Covid-19 or not, you should separate yourself from society,"" Gostin said. ""That's your part of the bargain; you're doing it for your neighbours, your family and your community.
""In exchange,"" he said, ""we as a nation owe you the right to a humane period of separation, where we meet your essential needs like medicine, health care, food and sick pay."""
7,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/video-showing-wuhan-residents-decrying-its-all-fake-as-chinese-official-tours-city,Video shows Wuhan residents decrying 'it's all fake' as Chinese official tours city,"BEIJING (AFP) - Videos showing residents at the centre of China's coronavirus epidemic haranguing a top Chinese official have highlighted persistent anger at how the authorities have handled the crisis.
The clips, which have been circulating online since Thursday (March 5), show occupants of an apartment block in the city of Wuhan yelling ""it's all fake"" from windows during an official neighbourhood inspection by Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan.
According to Chinese media, the complaints were an outcry against the community's property management, who were allegedly only pretending to have volunteers deliver vegetables and meat to inhabitants of the towers in the locked-down city.
Surprisingly, China's censors, usually quick to scrub any criticism of government officials, have allowed the home-made videos to remain on Weibo, the country's Twitter-like social media platform. But the central government appears to be seizing on the videos to craft a narrative that Beijing is listening to the demands of its people and that the local authorities are to blame for the mistakes.
State news agency Xinhua reported late on Thursday that Mr Sun has asked for ""in-depth investigations"" to address problems raised by Wuhan residents, although there is no mention of the video.
The People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, shared an edited version of one clip on Twitter, though it deleted the post on its English account, while the Chinese version was still online.
With no end in sight to the quarantine, which began in the city of 11 million people on Jan 23, many residents are depending on online group-buying services to get food.
Supermarkets and neighbourhood committees have scrambled to fill orders as demand rocketed, but some residents have told AFP that not everyone has been happy with the price and quality of mass-purchased food. Families have had to depend on themselves for resource, despite official reassurances that supplies were being channelled to the struggling city.
The nationalistic Global Times said on Friday that the local government in Wuhan has been ordered to ""investigate and solve the problem immediately"". It added that a central government guiding group for the epidemic urged local authorities to ensure that there are supplies for residents soon after the incident.
Meanwhile, Wuhan has launched an investigation in the community of over 3,000 to understand their concerns, added the Global Times.
Observers said the edited video tweeted by People's Daily seemed to be downplaying discontent. Mr Carl Minzner, an expert on Chinese law at Fordham Law School, tweeted on Friday that the clip suggested only one resident was shouting, instead of more heard in a longer version of the video circulating online.
He added that this suggests that party authorities were ""sufficiently worried"" about the original clip and suggestions of mass discontent in Wuhan that they came up with an alternative narrative.
China has been making rare exceptions to allow for criticism online in the epidemic, but mostly when directed at local officials, as the Communist Party attempts to shield itself from public rage.
In February, the death of whistle-blowing doctor Li Wenliang, who had contracted the virus, had unleashed a wave of anger at how officials handled the crisis.
People on Weibo voiced support for Wuhan residents, with one saying, ""I hope this has an effect.""
Another questioned why she could not find more information about the incident on social media despite official media reporting about it, wondering if it would make Weibo's ""hot search"" list."
8,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/climate-change-or-coronavirus-pick-your-evil-protesters-say,"Climate change or coronavirus? 'Pick your evil', protesters say","BRUSSELS (REUTERS) - Protesters at a rally led by climate activist Greta Thunberg on Friday (March 6) denounced governments for taking urgent action against the coronavirus outbreak but failing to treat global warming as an emergency.
Several thousand people braved the rain in Brussels with the 17-year-old Swede, marching through the city that is home to the European Union's main institutions.
""It is shameful that for so long the climate and environmental emergency has been ignored. We are still in a crisis that has never once been treated like a crisis,"" Thunberg told the demonstrators in a speech.
Some supporters said they had put aside concerns about being infected with the coronavirus in a crowd to join the march.
""It's pick your evil. Do you want to die from global warming or from coronavirus?"" said Gorkem, 40, wearing a face mask.
""One of them gets much more attention than the other, so we are trying to raise a bit more awareness about what is already affecting all our lives.""
Flo, a filmmaker from the Belgian city of Ghent who attended with her baby daughter, said the rapid spread of the coronavirus had demonstrated that governments can respond to crises.
""You see people all crazy with coronavirus and you see that governments can do things to make everybody aware about a situation, to make things happen... But they do so little about climate change,"" she said.
Organisers said some 4,000 people attended the event, fewer than expected, probably because of the weather and concerns about the spread of the virus in large crowds.
Andaga, 25, a marine biology student from Ghent, said some of her friends stayed away because of worries about the virus.
""I thought, okay, maybe I should carry hand sanitiser, but it was sold out everywhere ... Yes, it was a concern of mine but not enough to stop me from coming out and marching,"" she said.
While the protest went ahead, some events in the European Union's hub have been cancelled as a precaution.
The European Parliament has banned external visitors for the next three weeks, although it waived its own rule on Thursday to allow Thunberg to give a speech.
Other climate events have fallen victim to the virus. The United Nations on Friday postponed a week of climate change events in Kampala, Uganda, which had been scheduled for next month."
9,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/boeing-faces-us20-million-fine-by-faa,Boeing faces US$20 million fine by FAA,"NEW YORK (NYTIMES) - The Federal Aviation Administration recommended on Friday (March 6) that Boeing be fined nearly US$20 million (S$27 million) for installing equipment in the 737 Max and other aircraft before its approval.
The announcement came hours after Democrats on the House Transportation Committee slammed both the company and the agency for failing to ensure the safety of the Max jets. Two of the planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people and leading to the model's worldwide grounding.
The FAA accused Boeing of installing the equipment, the Head-Up Guidance System from Rockwell Collins, on nearly 800 jetliners from June 2015 to April 2019. The systems included sensors that had not been tested or approved when they were installed, though Rockwell Collins later conducted the necessary testing and risk analysis, the agency said in a statement.
In response, Boeing noted that the proposed US$19.68 million fine did not involve a safety issue and said a review had found that the systems ""met or exceeded"" the original requirements.
""We understand the critical importance of compliance with all documentation requirements of the FAA's certifications,"" the company said. ""We are committed to doing better.""
The agency accused Boeing of installing the systems in 618 Boeing 737 NGs and 173 Max planes. Boeing has 30 days to respond to the recommendation. Typically, the final details of such penalties are worked out in legal negotiations between the agency and the offending party.
The FAA proposed a US$5.4 million fine in January after it accused Boeing of installing substandard components in the Max and other aircraft. That fine has not yet been made final.
Earlier in the day, the House Transportation Committee's Democratic majority issued preliminary findings from a yearlong investigation into the Max disasters. The majority staff accused Boeing of overlooking safety in the interest of meeting production goals, making misguided assumptions about flight-control software known as MCAS and hiding information from the FAA, the public and Boeing customers, among other things. The report also accused FAA management of yielding to Boeing's influence and rejecting the safety concerns of its own experts.
""Our committee's investigation will continue for the foreseeable future, as there are a number of leads we continue to chase down to better understand how the system failed so horribly,"" the committee's chairman, Representative Peter DeFazio, said in a statement.
The Democrats also argued that Congress should change the FAA's aircraft certification process. The committee's Republican minority agreed that there were problems with the process and said it was open to bipartisan legislation, but dismissed the idea that the system was ""broken or in need of wholesale dismantlement."" The report was released just before the March 10 anniversary of the crash of a Max jet, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, that killed all 157 people on board.
""We have cooperated extensively for the past year with the committee's investigation,"" Boeing said in a statement about the findings. ""We will review this preliminary report."""

In a tweet on Friday, the Health Ministry said of the total number, 23 patients have recovered and were discharged.
Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the new cases include patients-under-investigation (PUI), close contacts and those involved in humanitarian aid missions to combat the effects of the disease.
""Among the patients are 65 Malaysians, 15 Chinese nationals, an American, a Japanese and an Italian,"" he said.
He added that the Health Ministry has also identified 956 people who came in close contact with the patients and collected test samples from them to detect the virus.
Out of this, 258 had come in close contact with Patient 26, with 18 of them testing positive.
""Seventy others tested negative but will be under quarantine for 14 days. We are waiting for the test results of the other 170 people and they have also been put under home quarantine and observation,"" he said.
He said the Health Ministry will continue with contact tracing to identify how Patient 26 was infected and prevent the illness from spreading further.
He said the ministry has also conducted Covid-19 surveillance to trace local and sporadic cases of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (Sari) as these patients have not travelled to affected countries or have any contact with any Covid-19 cases that have tested positive.
""So far, there have been no sporadic Covid-19 cases detected through this surveillance,"" he said.
Dr Noor Hisham also said the Covid-19 situation in Malaysia is at the early containment level.
""We advise the public to cooperate with the ministry's investigations in tracing anyone who came in close contact with the patients. Those identified will be contacted to help with further checks,"" he said.
Dr Noor Hisham added that under the Code of Professional Conduct under the Medical Act 1971 (Amendments 2012) and Medical Regulations, all medical practitioners must strictly ensure the confidentiality of patients’ personal and medical information.
He said that the conduct applies at all times unless the information is voluntarily revealed by the patients themselves.
""Therefore, the ministry will continue to maintain the confidentiality of patients’ personal and medical information,"" he said."

Mr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to combat the spread of the virus, told a briefing that patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) - seven as of Thursday - are in quite critical condition.
""So far our healthcare workers are working very hard and trying their best to support them and hopefully they can recover. But it's inevitable that at some point in time, we will see fatalities from Covid-19, as we've seen all around the world,"" he said.
Mr Gan has given a similar warning in the past. He told a briefing on Feb 12: ""While most infected patients will recover, some may become seriously ill, and a small number may succumb to the infection ultimately. We have to be prepared for the worst.""
Medical services director Kenneth Mak, who was also at Friday's briefing, said Singapore was ""fortunate"" that a number of those hospitalised were only mildly symptomatic and patients had been kept in the hospitals for long periods to ensure they are free of the virus before being discharged.
He told the briefing: ""There are some individuals in the ICU who are ill, (they) all require oxygen support, which for a large part involves the use of a ventilator. A number of these individuals have received other treatments, including the use of antiviral medications.""
While the Health Ministry does not comment on individual patients in the ICU, Case 42, a 39-year-old Bangladeshi worker hospitalised around a month ago, has yet to be discharged.
He had been in the ICU for about three weeks as of Feb 27. The Bangladesh High Commission said he had been suffering from respiratory and kidney problems and pneumonia before being infected with Covid-19."

The American Israel Public Affairs Committee said in an email to attendees, speakers and congressional offices that the pair had travelled from New York to go to the March 1-3 event.
""We have confirmed that at least two Policy Conference attendees from New York have tested positive for the Coronavirus,"" AIPAC said in the message, posted to its Twitter account.
Officials said on Friday that 22 new cases had been confirmed in New York state, mostly in a Westchester County cluster north of New York City, bringing the total to 44.
""We have continued to remain in constant communication with the Westchester County Health Department and the DC Health Department which is coordinating with the New York Health Department, and national health authorities,"" AIPAC added.
The event attracted high-profile attendees including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Democratic former White House hopeful Mike Bloomberg.
Lawmakers from all political stripes make an annual pilgrimage of sorts to AIPAC to pledge their support for the state of Israel on a grand stage.
About 18,000 people had been expected to travel from across the US to attend the conference, which typically attracts around two-thirds of the members of Congress.
Attendees swamped Capitol Hill in their hundreds during the event, as is the custom.
""If you test positive for Coronavirus, we urge you to inform your local health authorities so they can properly coordinate the response to this situation with the appropriate health authorities,"" AIPAC said.
In California, two federal health screeners at Los Angeles International Airport have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an email sent to their colleagues today and seen by Reuters.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention employees were conducting secondary screenings of passengers arriving from overseas, including from China, and have been directed to self-quarantine until March 17, the email said.
""At this time, we cannot confirm where these two screeners were exposed,"" said the email, which was sent by a senior CDC official. ""Let us keep our colleagues in our thoughts during this period.""
The virus has now killed more than 3,450 people and infected more than 100,000 across 92 nations since the outbreak first emerged in China in December. Over 3,000 of those deaths have been in China."

Two days after California declared a statewide emergency, wholesale stores visited by AFP on Friday (March 6) were unable to keep up with soaring demand for a range of staple items, as citizens prepare for the worst.
""It's pandemonium - our numbers are double the usual,"" said Rene, an employee at a Costco supermarket in Burbank.
""Today has been out of control. That's why we're out of toilet paper, out of almost all water, out of hand sanitiser.""
One person has died so far in California, which as of Friday had registered 69 coronavirus cases - second in the US only to nearby Washington state.
Despite officials' pleas for restraint, Californians have begun emulating the panic-buying seen across swathes of Asia and other regions.
""It's been nuts,"" Costco CFO Richard Galanti told analysts on a call Thursday.
The same day, police in San Bernardino County, near Los Angeles, were called to one store after customers became enraged by the lack of supplies.
On Friday, Costco shoppers were restricted to two crates of water, down from four the previous day.
Several tried to ignore the rule and saw their extra waters confiscated at checkout, leading to ""some pushing, a little bit,"" an attendant said.
A worker wheeling an overloaded cart of confiscated bottles back to their shelf was repeatedly stopped by new customers grabbing what they could.
Even Costco's famous free food samples had been suspended for fear of spreading the virus, another employee confirmed.
""With the madness here, it's starting to really set in,"" said Lisa Garcia, a 30-year-old retail worker who admitted she was growing seriously worried.
""We were thinking of stocking up on paper products, but look at those empty shelves!"" she told AFP.
At another nearby branch, employees reported shoppers dashing at full pace through the doors as the store opened, desperate to grab supplies.
By midday, only expensive sparkling Perrier bottles remained, to the disappointment of several shoppers.
But some shoppers, though concerned, managed to see the lighter side of the situation.
""I'm guarded,"" said emergency responder Andrew, who did not want to give his last name, wheeling a trolley filled with water, paper towels, limes and ginger ale.
""I want to make sure we have the essentials - some mixers, some wines, you know, so if things go bad I can make a drink."" ""I'm here just in case the apocalypse is going to happen,"" joked Carlos Gonzalez, a 35-year-old student.

15,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/senior-saudi-princes-said-to-be-detained-and-accused-of-treason,Senior Saudi princes said to be detained and accused of treason,"RIYADH (BLOOMBERG) - Saudi Arabian authorities detained a brother and a nephew of Saudi King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and accused them of treason, according to a person familiar with the matter - a move that extends a series of crackdowns on royal relatives by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne.
Former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was previously in line to be king before being sidelined, and Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz Al Saud - a brother of the current king - were arrested on Friday (March 6), the person familiar with the matter said. Mohammed bin Nayef's brother, Nawaf, was also detained with him during a raid on their desert camp, the person said. The news was reported earlier on Friday by the Wall Street Journal.
The Saudi embassy in Washington, DC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since King Salman ascended to the throne in 2015, his now 34-year-old son Prince Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known as MBS, has consolidated power with an unprecedented offensive against potential opponents in the family, arresting other princes and removing them from key posts as he took control of ministries and major institutions. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef is his older cousin, the previous heir to the throne and interior minister before being pushed aside in 2017.
Later that year, the current crown prince embarked on the most sweeping crackdown against other royals in the kingdom's history, ordering security forces to arrest senior princes and prominent businessmen in what was declared to be a crackdown on corruption. Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was detained at the Ritz Carlton Hotel for months, and Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was removed from his post as head of the powerful National Guard. While they were later released, many royals - including Prince Turki bin Abdullah, another son of the former king - remain under house arrest or are banned from travelling abroad.
Still, the arrests Friday will shake the kingdom's hierarchy even further. A full brother of King Salman, Prince Ahmed, is one of the only surviving sons of Saudi Arabia's first king, and was once viewed as a potential candidate for the throne. He's also a senior member of the allegiance council, a group of royals that votes on matters of succession. In 2018, he appeared in a rare video speaking to protesters in London, stirring controversy about potential discord in the ranks of the ruling family. He later issued a clarifying statement to dismiss questions about his loyalty. In October 2018, he returned to the kingdom after a period spent abroad.
The Saudi royal family has tens of thousands of members. While many of them pledge loyalty to the current crown prince, his consolidation of power has marginalised or alienated other relatives. The recent spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, and with it the prospect of a sustained period of lower oil prices, have only intensified potential risks for the oil-dependent kingdom.
Those risks were exacerbated after Russia on Friday refused to agree to Saudi Arabia's demand to cut output and prop prices up, sending oil prices plunging more than 9 per cent, the most since 2008.
""The Saudi leadership's challenges have snowballed in recent days,"" said Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group consultancy. He said recent developments may have made King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed's branch of the royal family ""more sensitive to risks of a coup,"" and ""these moves would remove the most serious obstacles to a potential change in the leadership."" The royal court told members of the allegiance council that Prince Ahmed and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef had been plotting a coup, according to the person familiar with the matter."
16,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/coronavirus-found-on-cruise-ship-as-more-us-states-report-cases,Coronavirus found on cruise ship as more US states report cases,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (REUTERS) - Twenty-one people aboard a cruise ship that was barred from docking in San Francisco have tested positive for coronavirus, US officials said on Friday (March 6), as half a dozen states reported their first cases of the fast-spreading respiratory disease.
Vice-President Mike Pence, who is running the White House's response to the outbreak, said at a news conference that 19 crew members and two passengers out of 46 people tested so far on the Grand Princess ship had the virus.
He said the vessel with about 3,400 passengers and crew would be taken to a non-commercial port where everyone on board would be tested.
US President Donald Trump said he would rather have passengers remain on board the vessel, but that he would let others make the decision whether to let the passengers disembark.
""I'd rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off,"" Trump told reporters after touring the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
Keeping passengers quarantined aboard a coronavirus-hit ship proved to be a disastrous strategy in Japan, leading to one of the world's biggest outbreaks.
Trump earlier signed a bill that will provide US$8.3 billion (S$11.4 billion)to bolster the country's capacity to test for coronavirus and fund other measures to stem an outbreak that has now killed 15 Americans.
On Friday, six states - Pennsylvania, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Nebraska - reported their first cases, bringing the total to 25 states that now have the virus.
Word of the new cases capped a week during which the virus began to disrupt daily life for many Americans.
In Seattle, the epicentre of the nation's outbreak, there were school closures and orders to work from home. In Miami and Baltimore, areas less affected by the outbreak, music festivals and sporting events were cancelled or curtailed as a precaution.
In the most high profile cancellation, the South by Southwest (SXSW) music and tech festival in Austin, Texas was called off on Friday.
As stocks plunge and US companies grapple with the economic fallout, the Trump administration is also weighing tax relief for the deeply affected cruise, travel and airline industries, according to a source familiar with the plan.
There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the respiratory illness, which emerged in China and has spread to more than 90 nations, killing more than 3,400 people and infecting more than 100,000 worldwide.
Americans are sharply divided over the dangers of the new coronavirus, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Critics of Trump, including Democratic lawmakers, have accused the president of downplaying the significance of the outbreak for political reasons. He has said the risk to Americans is low.
A union representing tens of thousands of US government employees on Friday called on the Trump administration to take the coronavirus seriously for federal workers, especially those working in areas directly impacted by the outbreak.
Washington's King County has been the hardest hit area in the United States with at least a dozen of the nation's 15 coronavirus deaths, several of whom were people living at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland.
The University of Washington announced on Friday that all classes would be held virtually for the rest of the winter term to limit contagion.
Apple on Friday asked staff at its Silicon Valley headquarters to work from home if possible as a""precaution."" Gap closed its New York headquarters because one employee had tested positive.
In Florida, Miami officials cancelled two music festivals on Friday - Ultra and Calle Ocho - because of potential risk that coronavirus could spread at events that bring large crowds into close proximity.
For similar reasons, the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament will go ahead at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore this weekend but without spectators, the university said on Friday.
The crisis has hit stocks hard. The benchmark S&P 500 closed down another 1.7 per cent on Friday, after falling nearly 3 per cent the day before.
As new states report their first cases, others watched their tally grow. Cases in New York jumped to 44 from 22, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday, adding that some 4,000 people in the state were under precautionary quarantine and 44 under mandatory quarantine.
But he also tried to stem any sense of panic by the public.""I think the anxiety and the fear is more of a problem than the virus,"" Cuomo said.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who was present at Trump's bill signing, said the CDC had already sent tests for 75,000 people to public health labs around the country, amid widespread criticism of not enough tests available for states in need.
Azar said a private contractor was working with the CDC to send kits capable of testing 400,000 people to private hospitals and labs nationwide.
""The production and shipping of tests that we've talked about all week is completely on schedule,"" Azar said.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged issues that slowed distribution of coronavirus tests, but said the overall response was going well.
""There were certainly some missteps in the beginning,"" he told NBC's Today programme. ""In the next couple of weeks we should be ratcheted up to get many more out."""

The death toll remained unchanged at 44 from late Friday, the KCDC added.
South Korea said on Friday that it would suspend visas and visa waivers for Japan in response to Tokyo's own travel restrictions on South Koreans, as fears over the spreading coronavirus rekindled a feud between the neighbours dating back to before World War II.
South Korea's curbs, which take effect on Monday, also include special entry procedures for non-Japanese foreigners arriving from Japan, Vice-Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young told a briefing.
At present, Japanese can visit South Korea for 90 days without a visa.
Seoul had earlier summoned the Japanese envoy to protest against Japan's decision to quarantine South Korean visitors for two weeks.
Japan is among almost 100 countries to impose curbs on travellers from South Korea, which has suffered 44 deaths and 6,593 infections in the biggest outbreak outside China, where the virus emerged late last year.
The number of cases in Japan grew to 1,112 on Friday, with 55 new infections reported from Yamaguchi prefecture, according to the national broadcaster NHK.
Thirteen of the new cases were people who visited a live music venue in Osaka or their family members, NHK said.
Japan has barred visitors altogether from highly affected areas in South Korea and ordered two weeks' quarantine for others.
""If the Japanese government does not withdraw its decision ... we cannot help but devise necessary countermeasures, including reciprocal measures,"" South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told Japanese Ambassador Koji Tomita.
Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters in Tokyo that the instructions, which also apply to visitors from China, would take the form of a request for them to stay in their hotels.
Seoul has also protested to Southeast Asian neighbours Singapore and Vietnam over similar curbs."

The Italian government has been watching closely to see if the cases are spreading from the richer north, where infections had largely been contained during the first 10 days of the epidemic.
All 22 Italian regions have now registered cases, and one new death was reported Friday in the Lazio region that includes Rome and its outskirts.
But there were no new deaths reported in the south, which recorded its first and only fatality in the southeastern region of Puglia around the city of Bari on Wednesday.

19,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/nut-rage-heiress-leads-coup-to-overthrow-younger-ceo-brother,Korean Air's 'nut rage' heiress leads coup to overthrow younger CEO brother,"SEOUL (BLOOMBERG) - After earning global infamy in what became known as the ""nut rage"" incident, heiress Heather Cho is poised for another fateful turn as she helps engineer a shareholder revolt against her brother atop one of South Korea's biggest conglomerates.
The former executive, who threw a tantrum and ordered a steward off a Korean Air Lines flight after she was served nuts in a bag rather than a bowl, is seeking to wrest control of the group that includes the carrier and a suite of hotel and logistics businesses.
Ms Heather Cho's alliance has demanded that the empire's leadership, including brother Walter Cho, 44, be replaced by ""professional managers"".
The sibling rivalry has spilled across the local press for months since Ms  Cho, 45, lent her support and voting rights to an alliance that includes an activist fund, which happens to be the biggest shareholder in the flagship Hanjin Kal.
The rebel shareholders have pushed for Mr Cho's removal as a board member, a seat that's up for a vote March 27.
Yet rather than undermine investor confidence in Hanjin Kal, the family feud has sparked a rally in the shares as Mr Cho has signalled he will go along with some activist demands that he sell non-core assets like hotels.
Also, Delta Air Lines has increased its stake, strengthening the alliance against Ms Cho.
Hanjin stock has almost tripled over the past 12 months and rose to a record on March 4.
The shares have rallied 67 per cent since Feb 20, even as the coronavirus crisis has been slamming aviation and tourism companies.
The dispute over who should run the Hanjin Group has helped boost the value of the Korea Corporate Governance Improvement (KCGI) fund's stake to about US$739 million (S$1.01 billion) as of Thursday (March 5), an early reward to the cornerstone of Ms Cho's alliance.
Still, the revolt has sent a signal that pressure for governance reforms hasn't been gaining traction, said Mr Park Ju-gun, president of corporate governance researcher CEOScore.
One takeaway is that the push towards greater respect for minority shareholder rights at chaebols - as family-run conglomerates are called in South Korea - has stalled, Mr Park said.
""If KCGI stayed on course and went on its own, then this could have been a signal of more reforms to come,"" he said.
""By joining hands with Heather Cho, the alliance has lost a lot of sincerity about wanting reforms.""
Mr Cho's office referred requests for comment to Hanjin Group, which declined to comment.
The lawyer representing Ms Cho said her stance on the group's management is the same as that of the alliance, which has a good chance of seeing its proposals approved at the shareholders' meeting later this month.
Like other chaebols, Hanjin Group succeeded for decades in keeping its sibling rivalries out of the news.
What went on within the family was held close, even as the late patriarch Cho Yang-ho, who succeeded his father as head of the group in 2003, faced embezzlement allegations that were unresolved at the time of his death.
Now, Ms  Cho's mutiny against Mr Cho could help the push for women's empowerment in a country that ranked last among OECD nations in gender pay equality.
South Korea also came in last in percentage of women on corporate boards among 30 countries, according to an Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) report.
Female representation was 2.3 per cent on boards in South Korea, ""where hermetically sealed, family-contained chaebols run a significant number of companies, and traditional attitudes around gender roles run strong"", ISS wrote in the report.
A 2018 report by Deloitte showed the country with 2.4 per cent female directors, the lowest other than Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
While Ms Heather Cho's challenge to her brother's leadership is a first for a female at a major chaebol, it is less surprising that she is behind it.
Along with the reputation for anger mismanagement, she has a history of getting her way.
The alliance she helped form controlled almost 32 per cent of Hanjin Kal voting rights, just shy of the 33.45 per cent held by younger brother, Mr Cho, and his group, which as of December included their mother, sister Emily Cho and Delta.
Voting at the shareholder meeting later this month will be based on stakes registered as of December, according to Hanjin Kal.
Ms Cho, along with the KCGI and Bando, a builder that held an 8.2 per cent stake, have demanded that Mr Cho be replaced with an established executive like former SK Telecom chief executive officer Kim Shin-bae.
Mr Cho has been at the group's helm since last year, inheriting the post after his father's death in April.
In some ways, his rise through the group's executive ranks was parallel to his older sister's advance.
As her role at the group grew, the Cornell University graduate with an MBA from the University of Southern California took charge over matters large and small.
While overseeing the growing business, she led an update of Korean Air Lines in-flight meals, including development of an award-winning noodle dish and a redesign of crew uniforms that won positive reviews.
Like other high-ranking daughters in corporate dynasties, Ms  Cho is looked up to by South Korean women, said Mr Lee Seung-hyun, an associate researcher at the Korea Women's Development Institute in Seoul.
""Heather Cho was seen as a role model, although she had that unfortunate incident.""
While Ms Cho has yet to live down the ""nut rage"" label, her siblings also have been accused of meltdowns worthy of a television drama.
Younger sister Emily Cho was pushed out of her job as a Korean Air Lines vice-president after allegations that she threw water in the face of an advertising agency worker during a business meeting.
About two months ago, Mr Cho apologised for smashing a vase at his mother's home on Christmas Day 2019 during an argument over the company's leadership and his older sister's role.
His mother, Mrs Lee Myung-hee, has apologised for the incident and joined the brother's alliance against Ms Cho, KCGI and Bando.
""It's known that Heather was more capable than her other two siblings,"" said Mr Lee of the Korea Women's Development Institute.
That assessment is shared by Mr Park of CEOScore.
""It's quite sad to see this happen to Heather, given that she was the better of the three siblings,"" Mr Park said. ""Heather is the first heiress from a top South Korean conglomerate to challenge management and try to take over.""
With the coronavirus crisis bearing down on the global airline and hotel industries, Ms Cho's alliance would need to show more detailed plans to win over smaller investors, said analyst Um Kyung-a of Shinyoung Securities in Seoul.
The rebel alliance ""hasn't really made any proposals that would appeal to investors to take their side"", she said.
For its part, KCGI reiterated that it wants professional management for the group and has made recommendations for candidates to the board.
Through a spokesman, KCGI also said that Ms Cho herself does not plan to take a management role.
""It's like watching a comedy,"" Mr Park said. ""This has shown that whatever they have previously said, greed was the purpose of all this."""

Citing a separate announcement in the Royal Gazette designating China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, Italy and Iran as ""Disease Infected Zones of the Coronavirus Disease 2019"", it said: ""The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) would like to recommend travellers from these territories that if the travellers feel these measures will be inconvenient for travelling in Thailand, they may consider postponing travel to another period and await further advice from Thailand's Ministry of Public Health regarding the health measures involved.""
The statement helped clarify confusion this week over Thailand's quarantine measures. There had been conflicting statements from the authorities in recent days about which countries were affected and whether a quarantine was mandatory for travellers.
Thailand's Health Ministry had also said yesterday that those arriving in the country from coronavirus-hit places, including Singapore, do not have to quarantine themselves.
Countries on the Health Ministry's watchlist include China, South Korea, Italy and Iran, as well as other countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States and Spain.
The ministry said that while a two-week self-quarantine was not compulsory, it was recommended.
""We haven't yet enforced the law to quarantine everyone except for the Thai workers returning from South Korea,"" Dr Thanarak Phaliphat, deputy director of the Disease Control Department, told a news briefing.
The announcement came one day after the Royal Gazette published the list of ""Disease Infected Zones of the Coronavirus Disease 2019"" in order to prevent and control the outbreak effectively.
Dr Thanarak said yesterday that visitors from these six places will be required to report to the Health Ministry.
""What we will proceed with in the next day or two is to require everyone coming from (these places) to report their symptoms daily through the Health Ministry's channels,"" he added. These communication channels include an app and the ministry's hotline number.
Dr Thanarak did not say how these reporting requirements would be enforced.
Thailand draws about 40 million tourists a year. However, the coronavirus outbreak has severely affected these numbers. The Tourism Authority of Thailand confirmed on Thursday that the country could see a loss of six million visitors this year, reported Agence France-Presse.
There were 48 confirmed virus cases in Thailand as of yesterday, with the latest case being a British man who travelled from London and transited in Hong Kong. There has been one death: A 35-year-old Thai retail worker.
Meanwhile, the local health authorities are bracing themselves for the return of thousands of undocumented Thai workers from South Korea, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases outside China at more than 6,500."
21,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-evidence-yet-that-different-virus-types-could-affect-severity-of-condition,No evidence yet that different virus 'types' could affect severity of condition,"As viruses are not static but prone to mutation, it is no surprise that there are subtle variations in the coronavirus causing Covid-19, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at the Ministry of Health (MOH), said yesterday.
""This is naturally due to mutations and how the virus evolves,"" he said.
But as the biological behaviour of the different strains is still being studied, it is not yet clear whether any of the virus subtypes are more aggressive, more virulent or behave differently, said Prof Mak.
He was responding to questions from the media at a news conference on a recent study by Chinese scientists who found that two types of the coronavirus - L and S types - appeared to exist.
The researchers said in their study, which was published on Tuesday in the scientific journal National Science Review, that the L type appears to be more aggressive and spread more quickly than the other.
Prof Mak noted that the Chinese study was done at the time when only 103 genomes of the virus were available on an international database. There are now 184 sequenced genomes, he said.
He added: ""We continue to look at this carefully and await more information from our scientific colleagues, researchers, who are actively involved in studies on the natural behaviour of the virus, as well as for ways to treat this infection.""
Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, deputy executive director for research at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Bioinformatics Institute, who is among the scientists studying the evolution of the virus, said that as more sequences are being uploaded onto the database, ""the data, not surprisingly, shows that the two variants they singled out are just two of many highly similar versions of the same virus"".
Dr Maurer-Stroh said: ""But importantly, and this was a weakness of the study, there is no known association or hard evidence for changes of severity for any of these variants.""
The study did not seek to analyse if the types of viruses identified had different properties, he said, but added that this was unlikely.
""It is important to note that the difference between these groups is minimal... and most variants by far are not linked to changes in severity, but could be neutral or even bad for the virus, making it weaker,"" Dr Maurer-Stroh told The Straits Times.
He said the differences between the two ""types"" can be likened to comparing two cars of identical type and colour, just with different licence plates.
""That licence plate helps you find out where the car was registered but not how fast it can go,"" he said, adding that more data is needed to determine the latter.
A virus' unique genome serves as a ""fingerprint"" to distinguish it from other viruses.
By comparing the genome of the virus causing Covid-19 with that of related viruses, scientists could identify parts of the genetic code that were unique to the virus, known as Sars-CoV-2.
These differences allowed scientists to develop a diagnostic test that will enable clinicians to diagnose patients with the virus.
The test works by flagging the unique parts of the viral genome in a process known as polymerase chain reaction.
Asked if the emergence of the different strains of the virus would affect the effectiveness of the diagnostic test kits, Prof Mak said that this does not appear to be the case.
""So far, the variations in the genetic make-up are in the areas that do not affect the testing of the virus,"" he said, noting that such tests are developed to be as sensitive and as specific as possible.
""(The tests are developed) by looking at common sites that are easily identifiable and not significantly prone to mutations, so even if the virus changes its make-up over time, the test will still remain sensitive,"" said Prof Mak.
But the tests will continue to be validated with samples from infected patients so as to ensure that they remain a valuable tool for diagnosis, he added.
The coronavirus is currently thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets.
Outside a living host, such as a human, a virus cannot replicate and is generally not considered a living thing.
Prof Mak said the greatest concern for infection would be in the first few hours after a droplet lands on a surface, although the exact time may depend on the surrounding environmental conditions.
""Once the droplet dries up, the virus would not last very long outside that protective environment,"" he said.
The Straits Times had earlier reported that the structure of a virus has to remain intact for it to start infecting a host.
Various measures, such as exposing the virus to heat or through the use of disinfectants, break its structure, rendering it impotent and unable to infect anyone.
For instance, if a respiratory droplet lands in an open area in the hot sun and that droplet evaporates quickly, the exposed virus would not last very long, Prof Mak said.
""But in other settings, that droplet may, in fact, last for longer periods on the surface,"" he added.
During yesterday's news conference, a new SG Clean Taskforce was also announced.
To be headed by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli and comprising representatives from various ministries, it was set up to raise hygiene standards at a national level."

Asian shares fell today following another Wall Street rout as fears of further disruptions to business continued to spread, stoking fears of a prolonged world economic slowdown. Japan's Nikkei stock index sank 2.8 per cent, while South Korea’s Kospi index tumbled 2.3 per cent.
This came on a day the Asian Development Bank announced that the outbreak is set to impact global growth rate. The Bank said the impact of the coronavirus could slash global gross domestic product by 0.1 to 0.4 per cent. In China, economic growth could be trimmed by 0.3 to 1.7 per cent while in developing Asia, excluding China, it could be slashed by 0.2 to 0.5 per cent. 
The grim news was supported by the S&P Global ratings too which said the battle against Covid-19 could wipe off US$211 billion (S$291.8 billion) off Asia Pacific economies this year, sending growth to its lowest level in more than a decade.

Chinese President Xi Jinping was due to travel to Japan to meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a trip that would have been the first of its kind in a decade. However, China announced that the trip will be postponed with both countries battling coronavirus. 
The announcement comes just after China decided to postpone its annual Parliament session for the first time since the Cultural Revolution. The meeting was due to be held in March. 
Associate Editor Ravi Velloor writes this would put additional pressure on Mr Abe with his government already facing criticism as the number of infections surpass 1,000, with 12 people dead. There are also questions about whether Japan will be able to host the Olympics as per original schedule.

It could get worse. The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Thursday that there were too many countries not taking all the steps needed to fight the spread of the deadly new coronavirus. ""This is not a drill,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.
Many governments were relegating the problem to their health ministries. But heads of government need to take charge. ""This is a time for pulling out all stops,"" he said. 
WHO has been relentless in calling on all countries to attach the utmost importance to the issue. Here are some recent reports:

Many of the political questions about whether he will be able to prove his support in Parliament remain unanswered and some members who've said they would support him are getting somewhat restless about how they could gain in return. But Malaysia's new Prime Minister seems unflustered and is focusing on building his administration first - with the country facing twin threats of a slowing economy and the spread of coronavirus.

31,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/asian-insider-video-cooperation-key-in-war-on-coronavirus-says-expert,"Asian Insider video: Cooperation key in war on coronavirus, says expert","WASHINGTON - Scientists need to cooperate with veterinarians and experts in animal industries to detect viruses before they become a problem in humans, says Dr Gregory C. Gray, Professor of Medicine, Global Health and Environmental Health at Duke University.
""The way to do that is to partner with professionals from human health, animal health, environmental health and the industries and looking at the viruses that may be crossing species at the human-animal interface,"" the global health expert told the Straits Times' weekly Asian Insider video and podcast.
Among other affiliations, Dr Gray is also a professor at the Emerging Infectious Diseases and Global Health Institute at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore and a professor of Global Health at Duke Kunshan University in China.
He was speaking on the Asian Insider show together with The Straits Times' South Korea Correspondent Chang May Choon.
South Korea is one of the top concerns internationally outside China, along with Italy and Iran, because of the magnitude of the coronavirus outbreak.
The East Asian country reported 5,766 cases on Thursday (March 5) with 35 people dead. This, though, South Korea has an advanced health care system and has administered several thousands tests for the coronavirus.
In contrast, the United States, caught flat footed, has yet to ramp up testing.
Dr Gray urged partnerships with professionals from human health, animal health, environmental health and the industries to look for viruses that may be crossing species at the human-animal interface.
""And once having identified a virus that crosses species, (they should) look for evidence that they may be causing infections in humans, and adapting as this virus has, to cause a lot of human to human transmission,"" he said.
The spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus has been ""surprisingly fast,"" he said.
""The reproductive rate - the number of people infected from one case - is higher than we would have anticipated, for instance for a seasonal influenza virus,"" he told Asian Insider.
""So this virus is particularly effective at moving from person to person,"" Dr Gray said.
""In addition to that, almost everybody is going to be susceptible to this virus in contrast with the seasonal influenza, (to which) many people will have some partial immunity, either due to natural infections or vaccines,"" he noted.
""So this virus is a real set up for moving very quickly across populations. And in populations where we have areas with dense populations and poor sanitation, we're going to see really fast epidemics and certainly long term care facilities - perhaps prisons, schools, and day care centres - will see a lot of transmission,"" he said.
""Governments have to decide how much social distancing makes sense for their populations, and we're beginning to see that right now in the United States with the cancellation of some big scientific meetings that I am aware of, and talk of more emergency response, things that are not critical for people being together.""
""In some countries we may even see some school systems shut down for a while. We have not seen such social distancing in this country (the US) for a long time,"" he said."

43,https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-9-highlights-from-this-years-committee-of-supply-debate,9 highlights from this year's Committee of Supply debate,"SINGAPORE - The House approved the Supply Bill on Friday (March 6), after MPs debated the Budget statement and ministries' spending plans over eight days.
Members of Parliament (MPs) filed more than 500 ""cuts"", or questions, for the 16 ministries - matching the record set in 2018, which had been the longest debate in the five years preceding. This did not include the 2½-day debate on Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat's Budget statement.
Here are nine highlights of this year's debate.
A comprehensive set of relief measures was announced as part of the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package this year to help businesses badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
Among these, the Enterprise Financing Scheme's Working Capital Loan, which helps small and medium-sized enterprises access financing for working capital needs, will be enhanced from March.
A $1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will offset 8 per cent of wages for every local workers for three months.
MPs Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC), Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) and Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio GRC) called for the scheme to be brought forward from end-July. The recommendation was accepted, with payments moved to end-May.
Under a $1.1 billion enhancement to the Wage Credit Scheme, where the Government co-funds wage increases, the monthly wage ceiling will be raised to $5,000, up from $4,000 for qualifying wage increases last year and this year.
Co-funding levels will be increased by 5 percentage points to 20 per cent for last year and 15 per cent for this year.
Taking a longer-term perspective, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing focused on two long-term drivers of change: global shifts and technology.
With supply chains disrupted by the Covid-19 epidemic, he said companies have to fundamentally re-examine the diversity and resilience of their supply chains.
Grant and tax schemes have been expanded to help companies venture abroad. Third-party consultancy costs will now qualify for tax breaks under the Double Tax Deduction Scheme for Internationalisation, while the Grow Digital initiative will help SMEs grow their business overseas via digital channels.
This emphasis on technology and transformation extended to debates on areas such as foreign affairs, defence, education, social policy and the environment.


To boost digital literacy, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that by 2024, all Secondary 1 students will own personal learning devices such as a laptop or tablet. Lower-income students will get such devices for free after subsidies.
To help them better handle new pressures stemming from the popularity of social media and smart devices, a new Character and Citizenship Education curriculum will place more emphasis on cyber wellness and mental health education.
Schools will spend about 50 per cent more time discussing cyber-wellness issues with students.
Climate resilience was a hot topic. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore has projected that by 2100, the mean sea level around Singapore will rise by up to 1m.
To ensure better flood protection, a $5 billion coastal and flood protection fund will be set up in the PUB.
To encourage the use of electric vehicles (EVs), more charging infrastructure will be provided, starting with public carparks. There will be up to 28,000 public charging points by 2030.
An EV Early Adoption Incentive will narrow the upfront cost difference between an EV and an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle by up to $20,000.
To ""green the fleet"", all new public bus purchases will be cleaner energy buses, including electric or hybrid buses.
A group of workers came in for special attention this year.
For those in their 40s to 50s - who shoulder heavy family commitments and risk being retrenched - the Government will incentivise employers to hire them through reskilling programmes such as Place-and-Train.
From April 1, it will boost salary support for all workers aged 40 and above enrolled in such programmes, from 70 per cent to 90 per cent.
Through programmes like TechSkills Accelerator Mid-Career Advance, Singaporeans aged 40 and above can enter emerging technology sectors while being trained and receiving a salary.


Freelancers, whose earnings have been badly hit, will welcome a $36 million scheme to help them upgrade their skills. They will get a training allowance of $7.50 an hour when they attend SkillsFuture courses.
Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soo GRC) noted that the public service already has childcare sick leave and paid parent-care leave, and pushed for these schemes to be made available to all workers in the private sector.
Persons with disabilities were highlighted by MPs such as Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar (Ang Mo Kio GRC), Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong GRC) and Ms Cheryl Chan (Fengshan).
Training course fee subsidies for this group will be raised. Their employers will also get help with salary offsets, capped at $400 a month in the form of a new Enabling Employment Credit.
Fee subsidies for special student care centres have been raised, so most families that qualify will pay 30 to 80 per cent less on average. For disability services, SG Enable will be the single touchpoint.
Single unwed parents can now buy three-room build-to-order (BTO) flats in non-mature estates, on top of the previous two-room and resale options.
Social inclusion extends to transport too. The Mobility Assistance for the Visually Impaired and Selected Users (Mavis), which alerts bus drivers to visually impaired commuters boarding and alighting, will be expanded to bus services that serve institutions such as the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped.
Schools will devote more attention to mental wellness and peer support, as part of curriculum changes to teach students when and how to seek help, as well as develop empathy and care towards those with mental health issues.
Similarly, polytechnics and the Institute for Technical Education have worked with the Health Promotion Board to develop mental health resources for students.
Employers can soon turn to a Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being to learn how to access anonymised external counselling service for their staff, or train supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early.
Caregivers of people with mental health conditions will get more support under a programme that involves hospitals and community partners like social service agencies. Details are being worked out.
They will receive information such as disease progression and expected care needs, and be linked up with relevant health, financial and social support services.
A Youth Mental Well-being Network will also be set up to bring together people who are keen to help those with mental health issues.
Responding to Nominated MP Anthea Ong and Workers' Party Non-Constituency MP Daniel Goh's questions on long wait times, affordability and the vulnerabilities of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) persons, Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor assured that there will be a whole-of-government review of Singapore's mental healthcare system.


A cyber-security label similar to the energy-efficiency labels on home appliances will be rolled out, to help buyers of smart devices better judge how exposed they are to cyber risks.
This label will be stuck on Wi-Fi routers and smart home hubs for a start. The labelling scheme will be extended to more Internet of Things (IoT) or connected devices.
As part of the war on diabetes, from end-2021, pre-packaged drinks with high sugar or saturated fat content will have to be labelled with grades ranging from A to D, with D being the unhealthiest. Retailers will also be banned from advertising D-grade drinks on all media platforms.
The same measures will be applied to freshly prepared drinks, such as those from bubble tea chains.
Charities are not spared - work is afoot to grade them using a regulatory compliance indicator.
Each charity's profile on an online portal will show whether it has met the minimum 80 per cent compliance prescribed in the Code of Governance for Charities and Institutions of a Public Character (IPCs), and whether the audit opinion in the independent auditor's report on the charity's financial statements has been qualified.
In this year's ""Unity Budget"", partnership under the Singapore Together movement - where the Government and Singaporeans co-create policy solutions - was the buzzword of the day.
Almost every speech stressed the need for collaboration.
Even as the Health Ministry rolled out new nutrition labelling and advertising restrictions for sugary drinks, MPs stressed the need for citizens to take ownership of their exercise and diet.
The Government is also putting money where its mouth is, setting aside $250 million to work with citizens on community projects.
A $50 million SG Eco Fund will also be launched to boost sustainability efforts among people and companies.
As Leader of the House Grace Fu said on the final day of debate: ""The momentum is clear. Singaporeans can and want to play a bigger role in shaping Singapore.
""Government agencies will be opening up many more opportunities for Singaporeans from all walks of life, all segments of the society, to co- create and co-deliver initiatives to make Singapore a resilient nation, a city of possibilities, a society with opportunities for all, and a caring and cohesive community."""
44,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-five-things-to-know-about-manchester-united-striker-odion-ighalo,Football: 5 things to know about Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo,"Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo has three goals from just two starts for Manchester United after yesterday's FA Cup fifth-round clash against Derby County. The 30 year-old netted a brace in the 3-0 win over the Championship side.
He overshadowed Derby player-coach Wayne Rooney, who was facing his former club for the first time since returning to England from Major League Soccer outift DC United last year.
Here are five things to know about Ighalo:
1. He is the first Nigerian to play for United after joining his boyhood club on loan from Chinese Super League outfit Shanghai Greenland Shenhua until June 30, 2020.
He went through a 14-day quarantine period before linking up with his new teammates as a precaution due to the coronavirus outbreak.
2. He dedicated his first United goal - against FC Brugge in the Europa League - to his sister Mary. She died at the age of 43 last December.
""She is a Man United fan. We prayed for this moment to play for United,"" Ighalo said after the last-32, second-leg match. ""Unfortunately she is not here to see me doing that. I promised I would dedicate every goal I scored.""
3. His poor family background inspired him to start up the Ighalo Orphanage Foundation in Lagos in 2017. He grew up in a slum.
""Back then in Ajegunle, it was difficult to live, difficult to eat and that is why I thank God. My parents didn't always have what we wanted or needed, we had to struggle,"" he told The Guardian.
4. His first pair of football boots were bought with money earned from selling bottled water and soft drinks. They were adidas Copa Mundials.
5. In 2015, Ighalo made his debut for the Nigeria national team. He represented his country at the 2018 World Cup and was the top scorer in their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification campaign and at the continental tournament, where they finished third."
45,https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/the-life-list-7-stunning-libraries-around-the-world,The Life List: 7 stunning libraries around the world,"SINGAPORE - Public libraries are treasure troves of knowledge and quiet calm where everyone is welcome. By the end of next year, residents in Punggol will get to enjoy the new Punggol Regional Library, which has been designed to be more inclusive. Besides facilities like calming zones for children with special needs, it will also provide services for users with disabilities.
The National Library Board (NLB) also plans to revamp eight other libraries from now till 2026, including Central Public Library, Choa Chu Kang Public Library and Queenstown Public Library.
The Straits Times looks at seven other libraries around the world famed for their good books and good looks.


This Colosseum-inspired library at the heart of downtown Vancouver is known for its stately granite walls curving into an unmistakable oval shape.
It has nine storeys, including a rooftop garden flourishing with local plant species like lavender, white roses and coral bark maple trees.
Between the second and third floors, visitors can catch a glimpse of a locked treasure chest containing items from the time of the library's opening in 1995. The time capsule will be opened again on its 45th anniversary in 2040.


With panels of dark wood and ornate cast iron, the Mortlock Chamber of this library could quite possibly set the stage for a Victorian-era period drama. The chamber was opened in 1884 as an expansion of the main building, which opened first in 1860, and some of the original wallpaper and lamps have been preserved.
During the day, plenty of natural light spills into the chamber from the glass-domed lantern roof overhead. The State Library has about 60km of shelves lined with books in total. It is fully wheelchair accessible, and hearing loops, an assisted listening technology, are available for visitors who are hearing impaired.


Resembling a large treehouse, this eco-friendly library stands amid the leafy environs of the Beitou hot springs. It was built in 2006, constructed mainly with wood and steel, and has a sloping roof where rainwater is collected for watering the plants or flushing toilets. Up on the roof, there are also solar panels and a layer of soil which provides thermal insulation.
Visitors can cosy up with a book inside, or head to one of the balconies to admire sweeping views of the surrounding gardens.


Nicknamed The Eye, this library is stunning and futuristic, if a little dystopian-looking.
A paper-white, spherical auditorium sits at the centre of the room, circled by five-storey-high undulating terraced bookshelves. From the entrance, it resembles the gleaming pupil of a watchful eye. Since opening in 2017, Tianjin Binhai Library has attracted thousands of visitors who come to admire the seemingly endless rows of books. Although the shelves do have the capacity for over a million volumes, however, most of the colourful book spines are actually just printed images.


With towering 13m-tall bookshelves and neon lights, this library is the star of Coex shopping mall. Since its opening in 2017, shoppers have had access to staggering shelves filled with some 50,000 Korean and international titles, just steps away from the escalators, restaurants and retail outlets. Though Starfield Library does not have a borrowing system yet, visitors can peruse their collection while getting comfortable on the plush sofas and many benches.


Nestled within the grassy groves of Akita International University, this library is a haven of peace and tranquility. It was constructed with cedar grown in the Akita prefecture, enveloping visitors with a woodsy fragrance when they step inside.
Many come to marvel at the intricate parasol-shaped roof, while students regularly pore over their notes in chairs that have been colour-coded by height to provide maximum comfort.
It was built in 2008, and is open to the students of the University 24 hours a day, earning itself the tagline ""the library that never sleeps"".


From the ground floor, the shelves of this ""mega library"" appear as though they are floating overhead. Like something out of a fantasy novel, it is easy for readers to literally lose themselves in the whirlwind of words here.
The bookshelves can hold more than two million items, divided by transparent walls, deliberately mismatched levels, and a labyrinth of balconies. Biblioteca Vasconcelos was inauguarated in 2006 and spans about 38,000 sq m, about the size of seven football fields."

Open seven days a week, Zam Zam stands out for its methods of preparing traditional dishes. Its murtabak, for example, is layered with an egg on top of the dough and sprinkled with minced meat, giving the stuffed dish extra crispiness.

Established nearly a century ago, Halal eatery Islamic Restaurant is one of the first restaurants to serve nasi briyani here in 1921. It continues to serve delectable North Indian dishes to customers.

The eatery also offers catering and has been doing so since it started cooking for events at the British High Commission and for a buffet lunch at the Padang for British expatriates in the 1920s.


Where: Five outlets island-wide, various opening times

In 2017, the restaurant even entered the Singapore book of records for making Singapore's largest ever murukku, a deep fried snack typically made with rice and dal flour.

Known for its diamond-shaped egg tarts ($1.90), the 85-year-old bakery still operates from its original shop in Chinatown. Its egg tarts' thin and flaky crust can be attributed to how they are made - employees roll and mould the pastries by hand.
The bakery is adamant on continuing this labour-intensive tradition as the taste of the pastry is altered when machines are used to make them, fourth generation owner Ana Fong shared in an interview with The New Paper in 2016.
Other pastries Tong Heng offers include coconut egg tarts ($2.20) and mini moon cakes ($3.20)

47,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coronavirus-5-good-personal-hygiene-practices-to-keep-the-virus-at-bay,Coronavirus: 5 good personal hygiene practices to keep the virus at bay,"SINGAPORE - A new multi-agency task force has been formed to raise the standards of cleanliness and public hygiene in Singapore, the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources said on Friday (March 6).
The SG Clean Taskforce aims to ensure the cleanliness of public spaces, encourage good personal hygiene and adjust social norms to reduce the spread of diseases.
Here are five personal hygiene habits that the task force recommended on Friday:
After using tissue paper to sneeze, cough or blow your nose, wrap it with another piece of clean tissue paper and throw them away in a dustbin. In hawker centres, do not leave soiled tissue paper on the table for cleaners to pick up.
The virus has spread in two clusters through group meals. It is best not to share food. If group meals cannot be avoided, using serving spoons can prevent germs spreading from one person to another.
This will prevent food from spilling or dripping from plates and bowls onto the tables, and cleaners having to pick them up, potentially spreading diseases.
This will reduce the spread of diseases and viruses such as Covid-19 and dengue within the community."
