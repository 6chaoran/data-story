## not so basic Keras tutorial for R
The basic tutorial of Keras for R is provided by keras [here](https://keras.rstudio.com/index.html), which simple and fast to get started. But very soon, I realize this basic tutorial won't meet my need any more, when I want to train larger dataset. And this is the tutorial I'm going to discuss about keras generators, callbacks and tensorboard.

### Keras Installation
If you haven't got your keras in R, just follow the steps at below:
```r
devtools::install_github("rstudio/keras")
library(keras)
install_keras()
```

### MNIST handwriting recognition
This is the code copied from the basic keras tutorial for MNIST handwriting recogintion.
I'm going to change based on this.  

```r
library(keras)
# donwnload dataset
mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y

# reshape
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), 784))
x_test <- array_reshape(x_test, c(nrow(x_test), 784))
# rescale
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

# one-hot encoding the label
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# define the computational graph
model <- keras_model_sequential() 
model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

# compile model
model %>% compile(
loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
metrics = c('accuracy'))

# model training
history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train, 
  epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, 
  validation_split = 0.2
)
```

## Generator
Generators are useful tools to build the training pipelines, such as functions like data sampling and preprocessing before feeding into model training.   
A particular advantage of generator is the case that training data is too large to fit into memory. We can prepare the training data files in parts and use generator to read data, preprocess and eventually feed into model for training.
`generator` in R is to define a function within a function, which is slightly different with python and syntax is record in this [website](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/introduction.html#generators).   
In this example, we can define a simple sampling generator, which serves as preprocessing pipelines - linking raw data to our expected data format by doing sampleing, re-scaling, re-shaping and one-hot encoding.
```r
sampling_generator <- function(x,y,batch_size) {
  function() {
    # sample a batch
    inSample <- sample(1:nrow(x), batch_size)
    x.sample <- x[inSample, ,]
    # re-scale
    x.sample <- x.sample / 255
    # re-shape
    x.sample <- array_reshape(x.sample, c(length(inSample), 784))
    # one-hot encoding
    y.sample <- to_categorical(y[inSample],10)
    # return format (feature, label)
    return(list(x.sample, y.sample))
  }
}

```

## Callback
Callbacks are used to control the training process, such as saving model, early stop and reducing learning rate.   
The full list of callbacks are show [here](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/training_callbacks.html).
```r
callbacks <- list(
  # record training history in csv file
  callback_csv_logger(format(Sys.time(),'model/log/mnist_%Y%m%d_%H%M.csv')),
  # early stop if eval_loss not improving for 5 epoches
  callback_early_stopping(patience = 5),
  # logdir for tensorboard
  callback_tensorboard(format(Sys.time(),'model/tensorboard/mnist_%Y%m%d_%H%M')))
```

## Tensorboard
Tensorboard is the UI view to compare different models as well as the model structure visualization.
To launch your tensorboard, type this in your terminal:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=/model/tensorboard/
```
after that, tensorboard will be available at http://localhost:6006. 
![tensorboard-1](https://github.com/6chaoran/data-story/raw/master/deep-learning/keras-R-tutorial/generator-callback/image/tensorboard-1.JPG)
We will notice that, there are no data captured in tensorboard, because we haven't run any model pointing to specified tensorboard directory.

## Training with generators & callbacks
We just need to specify the `callbacks` in the `fit_generator` and set the `steps_per_epoch` in each epoch, which is usually number of rows / batch_size. 

```r
valid.set <- my_generator(x_test,y_test,batch_size = nrow(x_test))()

hist <- model %>%
  fit_generator(
    my_generator(x_train,y_train,batch_size = 128),
    callbacks = callbacks,
    steps_per_epoch = 500,
    epochs = 50,
    verbose = 1,
    validation_data = valid.set,
    validation_steps = 1)
```

We now can see the our training history compared with keras example training. Our training stops early at epoch-11, because eval_loss becomes stagnant.
