In this post,  we build a model that provides end-to-end capability of detecting faces from image and predicting the BMI, Age and Gender for each detected persons.

# Model Architect

The model is made up by several parts:

1. input pre-processing pipeline:
    + load the image, resize to 224 x 224 and convert to array, which forms the features (X)
    + map the labels (y: {BMI, Age, Gender}) from meta-data
    + random sample from train and valid dataset to build the generator for model fitting
2. face detector (MTCNN):
    + alignment: pre-process the training data by cropping the detected faces
    + detect: when applying the model, detect the bounded faces from input picture and then apply the model for predictions.
3. face prediction (VGGFace):
    + transfer learning from VGGFace, with VGG16 and ResNet50 backbones
    + multi-task learning to learn 3 tasks together

The architecture of the model is described as below:

# Face Detection

Face detection is done by MTCNN, which is able to detect multiple faces within an image and draw the bounding box for each faces.

It serves two purposes for this project:

1.  pre-process and align the facial features of image.

Prior model training, each image is pre-processed by MTCNN to extract faces and crop images to focus on the facial part. The cropped images are saved and used to train the model in later part.

Illustration of face alignment:

2. enable prediction for multiple persons in the same image.
In inference phase, faces will be detected from the input image. For each face, it will go through the same pre-processing and make the predictions.

#Multi-task prediction

In vanilla CNN architecture, convolutional blocks are followed by the dense layers to output the prediction. In a naive implementation, we can build 3 models to predict BMI, age and gender individually. However, there is a strong drawback that 3 models are required to be trained and serialized separately, which drastically increases the maintenance efforts.

```
[input image] => [VGG16] => [dense layers] => [BMI]
[input image] => [VGG16] => [dense layers] => [AGE]
[input image] => [VGG16] => [dense layers] => [SEX]
```

Since we are going to predict `BMI`, `Age`, `Sex` from the same image, we can share the same backbone for the three different prediction heads and hence only one model will be maintained.

```
[input image] => [VGG16] => [separate dense layers] x3 => weighted([BMI], [AGE], [SEX])
```

This is the most simplified multi-task learning structure, which assumed independent tasks and hence separate dense layers were used for each head. Other research such as `Deep Relationship Networks`, used `matrix priors` to model the relationship between tasks.

# Dataset

The data used for training was crawled from web. The details of the web-scraping works are recorded in this post: web-scraping-of-javascript-website. This is fairly small dataset, which comprises 1530 records and 16 columns.

A very brief EDA was done to get the summary of data:

* sex imbalance: 80% of the data is male
* age is near truncated normal distribution. min Age is 18, average Age is 34.
* race is dominated by Black and White. Asian samples are very limited.
* BMI is normal distributed, with mean at 26.
* no obvious correlation found between BMI and Age, Sex.

```python
allimages = os.listdir('./face_aligned/')
train = pd.read_csv('./train.csv')
valid = pd.read_csv('./valid.csv')
 
train = train.loc[train['index'].isin(allimages)]
valid = valid.loc[valid['index'].isin(allimages)]
 
data = pd.concat([train, valid])
data[['age','race','sex','bmi','index']].head()
```

fig.set_size_inches((16, 3))
axs[0].barh(data.sex.unique(), data.sex.value_counts())

axs[1].hist(data.age, bins = 30)
axs[1].set_title('Age Distribution')
axs[2].hist(data.bmi, bins = 30)
axs[2].set_title('BMI Distribution')
axs[3].barh(data.race.unique(), data.race.value_counts())
axs[3].set_title('Race Distribution')
plt.tight_layout()
```

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1,3)
fig.set_size_inches((16, 4))
 
for i in ['Male','Female']:
    axs[0].hist(data.loc[data.sex == i,'bmi'].values, label = i, alpha = 0.5, density=True, bins = 30)
axs[0].set_title('BMI by Sex')
axs[0].legend()
 
res = data.groupby(['age','sex'], as_index=False)['bmi'].median()
for i in ['Male','Female']:
    axs[1].scatter(res.loc[res.sex == i,'age'].values, res.loc[res.sex == i,'bmi'].values,label = i, alpha = 0.5)
axs[1].set_title('median BMI by Age')
axs[1].legend()
 
for i in ['Black','White','Asian']:
    axs[2].hist(data.loc[data.race == i,'bmi'].values, label = i, alpha = 0.5, density=True, bins = 30)
axs[2].set_title('BMI by Race')
axs[2].legend()
 
plt.show()

# Model Training

A model class `FacePrediction` was built separately from the notebook. Please refer to [here](https://github.com/6chaoran/face2bmi/blob/fe279ad8bbe7948cbadb746d1eea0e42cc3130b9/scripts/models.py#L108) for the details of model.

```python
es = EarlyStopping(patience=3)
ckp = ModelCheckpoint(model_dir, save_best_only=True, save_weights_only=True, verbose=1)
tb = TensorBoard('./tb/%s'%(model_type))
callbacks = [es, ckp, tb]
 
model = FacePrediction(img_dir = './face_aligned/', model_type = 'vgg16')
model.define_model()
model.model.summary()
if mode == 'train':
    model.train(train, valid, bs = 8, epochs = 20, callbacks = callbacks)
else:
    model.load_weights(model_dir)
```

# Model Evaluation

The performance of tested models are quite similar. What surprised me is that, ResNet50 doesnâ€™t outperform VGG16.
Note: `VGG16_fc6` is the model that uses VGG16 as backbone, but extracted features from layer `fc6` instead of the last convolutional layer. This is recommended setting from this paper: [Face-to-BMI: Using Computer Vision to Infer Body Mass Index on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03156.pdf).

# Model Prediction

the built model class FacePrediction provides different predict functions

* predict: apply to either single image or a directory, and make subplots
* predict_df: predict from a directory and output as a pandas dataframe
* predict_faces: detect faces and predict for all faces

predict from directory:

```python
preds = model.predict('./test_aligned/', show_img = True)
```

predict multiple faces:

```python
preds = model.predict_faces('./test_mf/the-big-bang-theory-op-netflix.jpg', color = 'red')
```
