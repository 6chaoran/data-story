excerpt: "This is a modified `readthedown` rmarkdown template, which is greatly inspired and modified based on [juba/rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) package. `readthedown` offer a similar [sphnix](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) style, which is commmonly used in various python package documentations. I personally very much like the `readthedown` style and hence dive a little bit on the source code to figure out ways to make it easier for further customization."

In my [previous post](https://6chaoran.github.io/data-story/visualization/tips-of-drafting-r-markdown-document/), I shared how to effectively use various packages to create `thmlwidget`s to build interactive analytical documents in `readthedown` template, which I enjoyed for the most of time. However I feel tedious that I need copy some `yaml` config, custom `css` code, setup R chucks every time for new projects.

This is a modified `readthedown` rmarkdown template, which is greatly inspired and modified based on [juba/rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats) package. `readthedown` offer a similar [sphnix](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) style, which is commmonly used in various python package documentations.
