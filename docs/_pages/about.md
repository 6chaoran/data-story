### About Me

My name is Chaoran, from China and currently residing in Singapore.   
I used to be an Engineer with background of B.Eng Chemical Engineering and M.Sc. Industrial Engineering.    
But now I am a big fan of Data Science.


### About this Blog

I started this blog since Jan 2015, when I started my self-learning of data science. Having explored multiple online courses, quora threads, websites, textbooks, I was toddling in the sea of new things. The primary motivation of this blog to note down the learning journey and to summarize the useful stuffs I found.

I believe the best way to learn is to teach and to share. Hope this blog may help someone, who is also learning data science,  in any sense.
